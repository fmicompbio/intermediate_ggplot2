## Intermediate ggplot2 material

This repository contains tips and tricks related to `ggplot2` and extension 
packages, that go a bit beyond making 'basic' plots. 

### Contribution guidelines: 

- To contribute, modify the `intermediate_ggplot2.qmd` file. The document will 
be automatically rendered upon pushing to the `main` branch, as well as 
every Monday morning. 
- If possible, use one of the data sets that are described in the beginning 
of the document - if these do not provide what you need, add a section 
describing the new data set that you are introducing. Please use an informative 
name for the data object. 
- Add your name as an author in the document if it's not already there. 
- We define a custom theme in the beginning of the document (named `ggp`). 
Please use this if possible, for a more homogeneous look. 
- Also try to follow the coding style already used in the document, to make 
the different sections more comparable.
